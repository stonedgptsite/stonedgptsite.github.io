## write a rap about donuts in the style of the notorious big

Uh, yeah, you know who it is Biggie Smalls, the king of all of this

I'm in the mood for something sweet And there's only one thing that can't be beat Donuts, they're the ultimate treat The perfect food, can't be beat

Filled with jelly or cream It's like a dream, no need to scheme Just one bite and you'll know what I mean Donuts, they're the king of the scene

Sprinkles on top, glaze all around One taste and you won't hear a sound Except for the munching, the crunching, the chomping 'Cause once you start, you can't stop 'em

So if you see me on the street With a box of donuts, you know it's a treat Don't be shy, come on and take a seat And let's enjoy these donuts, can't be beat.
