## write a rap about mcdonald's in the style of the notorious big

### Verse 1:
I'm lovin' it, you know the sound
When I roll up to the drive-thru and order a pound
Of the Big Mac, super-sized with fries
A Coke on the side, no need for surprise
I'm talking 'bout McDonald's, the fast food king
They got the burgers and the nuggets, everything in between
And the prices so low, I can't complain
I'll be back tomorrow for the same thing

### Chorus:
McDonald's, it's the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it's always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs

### Verse 2:
I remember back in the day, when I was just a kid
The Happy Meal was the thing, I couldn't resist
A toy in every box, that's how they got me hooked
And now I'm grown up, but I'm still a fan, look
I hit up Mickey D's when I'm on the road
And even when I'm at home, I gotta have it, it's gold
The fries, the apple pies, I can't get enough
I gotta have it all, that's the real stuff

### Chorus:
McDonald's, it's the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it's always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs

### Verse 3:
They got the drive-thru, they got the dine-in
And if you're in a rush, they got the mobile ordering
So whether you're on the run or just wanna chill
You can get your fix at Mickey D's, for real
And I ain't even talkin' 'bout the breakfast menu
The sausage McMuffin, the hash browns, so simple
And I gotta shout out the McRib, that's a classic
I'll take one of those any day, fantastic

### Chorus:
McDonald's, it's the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it's always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs

### Outro:
So there you have it, my ode to the golden arches
I gotta give it up, 'cause they got the hardest
Fast food game on lock, it's no question
When it comes to McDonald's, I'm a real obsession.
