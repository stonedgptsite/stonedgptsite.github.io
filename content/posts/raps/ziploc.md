## write a rap about ziploc in the style of the notorious big

### Verse 1:
I keep my food fresh, my money long
Ziploc bags in my kitchen, that's where they belong
Got a variety of sizes, for all my needs
From sandwiches to leftovers, it's how I succeed

### Chorus:
Ziploc, ziploc, can't nobody do it like you do
Keep my food fresh and my kitchen looking brand new
Ziploc, ziploc, the notorious way to store
My meals for later, never been fresher before

### Verse 2:
I'm notorious for my flavor, not for wasting food
Ziploc keeps my ingredients intact, that's the mood
I got love for the plastic, it's not just for show
Keeps my food fresh, so I can always go

### Chorus:
Ziploc, ziploc, can't nobody do it like you do
Keep my food fresh and my kitchen looking brand new
Ziploc, ziploc, the notorious way to store
My meals for later, never been fresher before

### Verse 3:
I got mad respect for my Ziploc, it's my secret weapon
Got the freshness locked down, so I'm always steppin'
In the kitchen with confidence, never wasting a bite
Thanks to Ziploc, everything's just right

### Chorus:
Ziploc, ziploc, can't nobody do it like you do
Keep my food fresh and my kitchen looking brand new
Ziploc, ziploc, the notorious way to store
My meals for later, never been fresher before

### Outro:
So here's a shoutout to my Ziploc, my kitchen MVP
Keeps my food fresh and my lifestyle stress-free
Never leave home without one, that's my motto
Ziploc, you're the real OG, here's to your legacy, bravo!
