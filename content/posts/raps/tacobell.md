Taco Bell's my jam, that's where I go
I love the tacos, the burritos, the chalupas
Gotta get my fix, nothing else will do ya

Taco Bell, Taco Bell, can't nobody do it like you do
My taste buds are in heaven, my stomach's feeling brand new
Taco Bell, Taco Bell, notorious for your flavor
My go-to spot, no other can savor

The Crunchwrap Supreme, it's my favorite dish
I can't get enough, it's like a magic wish
The nachos and cheese, it's a perfect pair
It's like they were made, for each other to share

Taco Bell, Taco Bell, can't nobody do it like you do
My taste buds are in heaven, my stomach's feeling brand new
Taco Bell, Taco Bell, notorious for your flavor
My go-to spot, no other can savor

I don't play around, my taste buds need that glow
I hit the sauce packets hard, gotta get that flavor
It's like the taco gods, just did me a favor
