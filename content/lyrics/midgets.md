## write a rap about midgets in the style of the notorious big


### Verse 1:
I'm the king of the rhymes, notorious B.I.G.
But I'm not here to talk about money or bling
I'm spittin' a flow 'bout a topic quite small
But they stand tall, the little people, hear my call

### Chorus:
Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don't underestimate, don't belittle their size
They're warriors in disguise, look 'em in the eyes

### Verse 2:
They face ridicule, but they never give in
They keep movin' forward, they keep on livin'
They may be pint-sized, but their spirits are great
They rise above hate, they never hesitate

### Chorus:
Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don't underestimate, don't belittle their size
They're warriors in disguise, look 'em in the eyes

### Verse 3:
They may be overlooked, but they're not to be ignored
They got strength in their bones, they got soul in their cords
They got more fight in 'em than most people I know
They prove time and again, they're not just for show

### Chorus:
Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don't underestimate, don't belittle their size
They're warriors in disguise, look 'em in the eyes

### Outro:
So let's give it up, for the little ones that could
They're misunderstood, but they're still so good
They may be small, but they got big hearts and minds
Midgets, little people, they're one of a kind.
