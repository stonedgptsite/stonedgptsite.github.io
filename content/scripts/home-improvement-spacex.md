FADE IN:

INT. TOOL TIME SET - DAY

Tim is standing on stage with Al, introducing their special guest for the day.

**TIM**:
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special guest with us today. He's an entrepreneur, inventor, and a true visionary. Please welcome the one and only Elon Musk!"

Elon walks onto the stage, waving to the audience as they cheer.

**ELON**:
"Thank you, Tim. It's great to be here."

**AL**:
(under his breath)
"Yeah, great for you. You get to go to space and leave us all behind."

**TIM**:
"What was that, Al?"

**AL**:
"Oh, nothing, Tim. Just admiring our guest's accomplishments."

**ELON**:
"Well, as a matter of fact, Tim, that's why I'm here today. I'd like to invite you to join me on a trip to space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket."

**TIM**:
(stunned)
"Me? Go to space? I don't know if I'm ready for that."

**ELON**:
"Don't worry, Tim. We'll make sure you're fully trained and prepared for the journey."

**AL**:
(still jealous)
"What about me? Can I come too?"

**ELON**:
(smiling)
"Sorry, Al. We only have room for one passenger on this trip."

**AL** looks disappointed, but Tim is clearly excited.

INT. **ELON** MUSK'S SPACECRAFT - LAUNCH DAY

Tim is suited up and strapped into his seat, looking both thrilled and nervous. Elon is sitting next to him, going through some final checks.

**ELON**:
"Don't worry, Tim. This is going to be an amazing experience."

**TIM**:
"I trust you, Elon. Let's do this!"

The engines start to roar as the spacecraft begins to ascend into the sky. Tim's face is a mixture of awe and terror as he watches the ground disappear beneath them.

Suddenly, there's a loud explosion, and the spacecraft starts to shake violently.

**ELON**:
(horrified)
"Oh no, something's gone wrong. Brace yourself, Tim!"

There's another explosion, and the spacecraft starts to disintegrate around them. Tim's screams are drowned out by the sound of the explosion.

CUT TO:

INT. TOOL TIME SET - LATER THAT DAY

Jill and the boys are watching the news coverage of the spacecraft disaster, with looks of shock and sadness on their faces.

**JILL**:
(pale and trembling)
"Oh my God, Tim was on that spacecraft. He's... he's gone."

**BRAD**:
(tearfully)
"Dad can't be dead. He can't be!"

**RANDY**:
(crying)
"Why did he have to go to space? Why did he have to leave us?"

**AL**:
(sadly)
"I should have been on that spacecraft. I should have been the one to go."

**JILL**:
(hugging the boys)
"We'll get through this together. Tim will always be with us in our hearts."

FADE TO BLACK.
