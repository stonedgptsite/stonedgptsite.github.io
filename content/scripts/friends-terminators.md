FADE IN:

INT. CENTRAL PERK COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The friends are gathered in their usual spot in Central Perk, sipping coffee and chatting when suddenly the door bursts open and a menacing figure enters - a T-1000 Terminator.

The friends scream and scatter, running for their lives as the Terminator gives chase, its liquid metal form shifting and morphing as it relentlessly pursues them.

**ROSS**: (panting) What the hell is going on?! We're being hunted by a freaking Terminator?!

**RACHEL**: (breathless) We have to get out of here!

**MONICA**: (looking around frantically) Where's Chandler? Is he safe?

**JOEY**: (pointing) There he is!

**CHANDLER** comes running in from the back room, clutching a frying pan for defense.

**CHANDLER**: (gasping) I was in the bathroom, what's going on?!

**PHOEBE**: (grabbing Chandlers arm) We're being chased by a Terminator!

The T-1000 bursts through the door, its arms transforming into deadly blades as it advances on the friends.

**MONICA**: (looking for an escape route) We have to find a way out of here!

**RACHEL**: (noticing a fire exit) Over there!

The friends make a break for the door, but the Terminator is right behind them, its liquid metal form oozing through the cracks and crevices of the coffee shop.

**JOEY**: (panicking) We're never gonna make it!

Just as it seems like all hope is lost, a familiar figure steps out from behind the Terminator - it's Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as the T-800 from the Terminator franchise.

**ARNOLD**: (smirking) Get down!

The friends hit the ground as the T-800 unleashes a barrage of gunfire on the T-1000, sending it flying backwards and shattering it into a million pieces.

**ARNOLD**: (helping the friends to their feet) Are you okay?

**MONICA**: (in disbelief) Arnold Schwarzenegger just saved our lives!

**CHANDLER**: (stunned) And he's the good Terminator this time!

The friends look on in awe as Arnold walks out of the coffee shop, disappearing into the streets of New York.

**ROSS**: (shaking his head) I can't believe this just happened.

**RACHEL**: (smiling) You can say that again.

FADE OUT.
