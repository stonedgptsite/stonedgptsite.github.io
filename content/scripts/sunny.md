INT. PADDY'S PUB - DAY

We see a group of Sesame Street characters sitting around a table. Elmo is holding a beer, Cookie Monster is eating a sandwich, Big Bird is flipping through a magazine, Oscar the Grouch is hiding in a trash can, and Grover is nervously fidgeting.

ELMO: "Boy oh boy, this is a great day for a beer, isn't it guys?"

COOKIE MONSTER: "Oh yeah, me love sandwiches and beer! Nom nom nom!"

BIG BIRD: "I don't know, guys. Should we really be drinking in the middle of the day?"

OSCAR THE GROUCH: "Who cares? I'm just here to get drunk and forget about my miserable life in this trash can."

GROVER: "I don't think we should be drinking at all. It's not very responsible."

Suddenly, the door to the pub bursts open and in walks Bert and Ernie, both dressed in suits and looking very serious.

BERT: "Hey guys, we have a proposition for you."

ERNIE: "Yeah, we're thinking about investing in a new business venture and we want you guys to be a part of it."

ELMO: "A business venture? Sounds interesting!"

COOKIE MONSTER: "Is it a sandwich shop? Me love sandwiches!"

BIG BIRD: "I don't know, guys. We don't really have any experience running a business."

OSCAR THE GROUCH: "Who cares? As long as it makes us money, I'm in."

GROVER: "I don't know, this seems like a risky investment. What's the business?"

BERT: "Well, it's a new kind of cookie. We're calling it 'Bert and Ernie's Delicious Cookies'."

ERNIE: "And we need your help to promote it."

ELMO: "A cookie business? That sounds like a great idea! We can sell them at the pub!"

COOKIE MONSTER: "Me love cookies! Let's do it!"

BIG BIRD: "I don't know, guys. We should really think about this before we make a decision."

OSCAR THE GROUCH: "Oh, shut up, Big Bird. You're always such a buzzkill."

GROVER: "I don't know, I think Big Bird has a point. We should really consider the risks involved."

BERT: "Come on, guys. You'll be making a lot of money off this venture. What could go wrong?"

ERNIE: "Yeah, we're all friends here. Let's do it!"

The group eventually agrees to invest in the cookie business and they spend the rest of the episode trying to come up with creative ways to promote the cookies. In the end, they discover that the cookies are actually terrible and no one wants to buy them. The group loses all their money and is left with a bunch of unsellable cookies.

ELMO: "Well, that was a disaster."

COOKIE MONSTER: "Me should have stuck to sandwiches."

BIG BIRD: "I told you guys this was a bad idea."

OSCAR THE GROUCH: "Ugh, I can't even afford to buy a drink now."

GROVER: "I guess we learned our lesson. We should stick to what we know."

The group ends the episode by sharing a few sad laughs and trying to figure out how to get rid of the mountain of cookies that they're now stuck with.
