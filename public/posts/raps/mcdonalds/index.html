    <h2 id="write-a-rap-about-mcdonalds-in-the-style-of-the-notorious-big">write a rap about mcdonald&rsquo;s in the style of the notorious big</h2>
<h3 id="verse-1">Verse 1:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it, you know the sound
When I roll up to the drive-thru and order a pound
Of the Big Mac, super-sized with fries
A Coke on the side, no need for surprise
I&rsquo;m talking &lsquo;bout McDonald&rsquo;s, the fast food king
They got the burgers and the nuggets, everything in between
And the prices so low, I can&rsquo;t complain
I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow for the same thing</p>
<h3 id="chorus">Chorus:</h3>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it&rsquo;s always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs</p>
<h3 id="verse-2">Verse 2:</h3>
<p>I remember back in the day, when I was just a kid
The Happy Meal was the thing, I couldn&rsquo;t resist
A toy in every box, that&rsquo;s how they got me hooked
And now I&rsquo;m grown up, but I&rsquo;m still a fan, look
I hit up Mickey D&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m on the road
And even when I&rsquo;m at home, I gotta have it, it&rsquo;s gold
The fries, the apple pies, I can&rsquo;t get enough
I gotta have it all, that&rsquo;s the real stuff</p>
<h3 id="chorus-1">Chorus:</h3>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it&rsquo;s always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs</p>
<h3 id="verse-3">Verse 3:</h3>
<p>They got the drive-thru, they got the dine-in
And if you&rsquo;re in a rush, they got the mobile ordering
So whether you&rsquo;re on the run or just wanna chill
You can get your fix at Mickey D&rsquo;s, for real
And I ain&rsquo;t even talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout the breakfast menu
The sausage McMuffin, the hash browns, so simple
And I gotta shout out the McRib, that&rsquo;s a classic
I&rsquo;ll take one of those any day, fantastic</p>
<h3 id="chorus-2">Chorus:</h3>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the place to be
Get your meal in a hurry, and it&rsquo;s always tasty
From the burgers to the shakes, they got everything you need
So come on down and satisfy your needs</p>
<h3 id="outro">Outro:</h3>
<p>So there you have it, my ode to the golden arches
I gotta give it up, &lsquo;cause they got the hardest
Fast food game on lock, it&rsquo;s no question
When it comes to McDonald&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m a real obsession.</p>
