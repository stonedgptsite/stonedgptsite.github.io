<h3 id="verse-1">Verse 1:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m the king of the rhymes, notorious B.I.G.
But I&rsquo;m not here to talk about money or bling
I&rsquo;m spittin&rsquo; a flow &lsquo;bout a topic quite small
But they stand tall, the little people, hear my call</p>
<h3 id="chorus">Chorus:</h3>
<p>Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don&rsquo;t underestimate, don&rsquo;t belittle their size
They&rsquo;re warriors in disguise, look &rsquo;em in the eyes</p>
<h3 id="verse-2">Verse 2:</h3>
<p>They face ridicule, but they never give in
They keep movin&rsquo; forward, they keep on livin&rsquo;
They may be pint-sized, but their spirits are great
They rise above hate, they never hesitate</p>
<h3 id="chorus-1">Chorus:</h3>
<p>Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don&rsquo;t underestimate, don&rsquo;t belittle their size
They&rsquo;re warriors in disguise, look &rsquo;em in the eyes</p>
<h3 id="verse-3">Verse 3:</h3>
<p>They may be overlooked, but they&rsquo;re not to be ignored
They got strength in their bones, they got soul in their cords
They got more fight in &rsquo;em than most people I know
They prove time and again, they&rsquo;re not just for show</p>
<h3 id="chorus-2">Chorus:</h3>
<p>Midgets, little people, vertically challenged
They may be small, but their hearts are enlarged
Don&rsquo;t underestimate, don&rsquo;t belittle their size
They&rsquo;re warriors in disguise, look &rsquo;em in the eyes</p>
<h3 id="outro">Outro:</h3>
<p>So let&rsquo;s give it up, for the little ones that could
They&rsquo;re misunderstood, but they&rsquo;re still so good
They may be small, but they got big hearts and minds
Midgets, little people, they&rsquo;re one of a kind.</p>
